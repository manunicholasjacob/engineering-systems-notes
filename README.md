# Engineering Systems Notes

This repository contains short essays on engineering systems, design, and reliability.

The focus is on systems-level reasoning: how complex systems behave under constraints, how failure modes emerge over time, and how design decisions shape reliability long before issues surface.

These notes are intentionally abstract and pattern-based. They are not tied to any specific company, product, or incident, and are meant to remain broadly applicable across hardware, software, organizations, and processes.

## Articles

### Why Most System Failures Aren’t Isolated Failures
An exploration of why failures in complex systems often emerge from interactions rather than discrete defects, and why local debugging can miss the underlying cause.

### Why Local Optimizations Quietly Break Systems
A systems-level discussion of how reasonable local improvements can narrow margins, strengthen coupling, and push systems toward fragility through second-order effects.

### Constraints Shape System Behavior Long Before They Break It
An examination of how constraints influence system behavior continuously, long before limits are exceeded, shaping feedback, stability, and failure modes.

### Reliability Is a Design Property, Not an Operational Outcome
A reflective discussion of why reliability is shaped by design decisions rather than incident response, and why recovery speed alone is an incomplete measure of resilience.

Additional essays may be added over time as these themes are explored further.

## Scope and Intent

These notes are written from the perspective of an engineer developing a deeper understanding of systems behavior.

They aim to:
- Emphasize structure over anecdotes  
- Focus on patterns rather than prescriptions  
- Treat constraints, feedback, and interactions as first-class design concerns  

They are not intended as tutorials, playbooks, or postmortems.

## LinkedIn

Some of these essays are also published as long-form articles on LinkedIn, primarily for discussion and reflection.

If you found an article through LinkedIn, this repository serves as a durable home for the full set of notes and future additions.
